We are seeking a visionary

and pragmatic

leader to oversee our data and analytics team. This role requires not only technical expertise but also

a relentless focus on making experimentation, reporting, and automation core to how we run the business

. The VP will

lead our experimentation and reporting platforms (A/B testing, SQL Server, Power BI dashboards, and GA/BigQuery reporting)

while also pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with data science and AI to create a future-oriented analytics culture.

What You’ll Do

Own and scale the company’s experimentation and reporting infrastructure (Power BI dashboards, SQL Server data, GA, BigQuery, and A/B testing)

to make data and insights widely accessible across the business.

Partner with stakeholders to identify analytics and experimentation needs,

delivering automated dashboards and insights that reduce manual reporting and speed decision-making.

Drive strategic data initiatives,

with a priority on adoption and broad usage of the experimentation and reporting platforms as “job one.”

Build a vision and roadmap for the function, ensuring scalability and impact,

while delivering quick wins in reporting automation, test analysis, and data accessibility.

Evangelize data-driven decision-making and AI across the organization,

with a bias toward practical application (e.g., connecting LLMs to SQL, automating reporting, and enabling non-technical users to self-serve).

Lead and mentor a global team, developing leaders who are strong technical contributors and effective business partners.

Anticipate future needs and opportunities, including

expanding use of predictive ML, generative AI, and unstructured data analysis (e.g., CSAT and customer interactions) to unlock new insights.

Who You Are

A builder who thrives on balancing visionary strategy with hands-on execution in reporting, experimentation, and AI adoption.

An experienced leader with a track record of driving adoption of

reporting/experimentation platforms

as well as advanced analytics.

Passionate about leveraging

AI and automation not as abstract ideas but as tools to eliminate manual work, accelerate insights, and expand access to data.

Comfortable operating in ambiguity, with the ability to deliver quick wins while building long-term roadmaps.

Strong technical foundation in SQL, Power BI, and A/B testing frameworks, with fluency in Python and other tools for ad hoc analysis.

Proven experience leading global teams and cultivating both technical and leadership talent.

Success in Year One

Company-wide adoption of the experimentation and reporting platforms (SQL Server, Power BI, GA/BigQuery, A/B testing).

Automation of a significant portion of recurring reporting and test analysis, freeing the team from manual work.

Demonstrated use of AI in production (e.g., LLMs generating SQL queries, automated reporting for non-technical teams, or AI-assisted analysis of unstructured data like CSAT).

Established a clear vision and roadmap for scaling the function, with visible impact across multiple departments.
